## Blog about what you found the most interesting and the most surprising in the talk given by Kevin Fleming in class
I found it most interesting hearing about how much Bloomberg actually gives back to and supports the open source community.
I didn't expect a company so large to be willing to be so supportive of a community like this. I also really liked hearing 
about how open source code gets integrated into the code that Bloomberg uses to support its terminal.

## Blog about your personal progress towards the team project: what have you done, what did you learn, what are the tasks that you will be working on next week
This week we shifted our focus away from the documentation and towards some actual code. I spent this week creating a sample
evtx event that we can use to test the functions we will make. Then I started writing one of the first functions we will
be submitting as part of our contribution this semester.
