##Open Source
###What do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"?
I think of software (usually on github) that anyone can access and contribute to and that is usually worked on by a large team of people all over the world.
###What are some advantages of open vs. closed source?
Some of the advantages are that it's easy to contribute to it so you can get a team of people together without worrying about finding a common space or time that everyone can meet. Another advantage is that access is usually free so the users aren't bound by monetary restrictions.
###What are some potential problems with open source? 
One potential problem is that you run the risk of having too many contributors which might make it slower to develop the code.
###Why did you decide to register for a class about open source software development?
I registered for this class because I want to contribute to more open source projects and I'm hoping that this class will give me more confidence about making contributions
