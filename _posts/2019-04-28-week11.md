title: Week 11

## Your posts this week should contain a summary of your own contributions to the group project.
My contributions to the group project have consisted of creating the initial commit for the group wiki, writing the declaration
for the function we will be creating as our main contribution, and writing the example event that we will be using to test 
whether or not our function works. Additionally, a lot of my work has been practicing git with Alisha. She absolutely knows more than I do about this and she has been so patient with me as I learn how to do things like rebase and reorder commits
