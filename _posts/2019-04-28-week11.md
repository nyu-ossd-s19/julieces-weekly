title: Week 11

## Your posts this week should contain a summary of your own contributions to the group project.
My contributions to the group project have consisted of creating the initial commit for the group wiki, writing the declaration
for the function we will be creating as our main contribution, and writing the example event that we will be using to test 
whether or not our function works.
