## describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building your browser extension
I wrote the content script file as well as the README. I additionally added links to the CONTRIBUTION file and found all of the images we needed to make our extension work the way we wanted to.

## describe the state of your browser extension project: what progress your team make, what problems you encountered, will you have a working product by the due date
Our team was able to create most of the necessary files and run a few preliminary tests. I think the most difficult problem we encountered was figuring out our naming convention and making sure that everyone maintained that, but otherwise it was pretty smooth. If everything continues the way it's going and we don't have any crazy errors, we should have a working product by the due date

## describe at least one thing about git or gitHub that you learned this week (something that was new to you)
I learned that you can create an upstream repository after you've forked the repo and I sort of re-learned the basics because I haven't used them in a while.
