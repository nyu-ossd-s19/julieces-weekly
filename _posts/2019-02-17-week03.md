## Experience creating a browser extension
I found that it was easier working with my group members when we were in person. We didn't really attempt to collaborate remotely, I think it would've been easier to do so if we had a more distinct separation of who was going to work on what by the time class ended. We ended up meeting in person and communicated verbally. The most difficult part of this project was debugging the code when we put it all together. It was easy enough to resolve merge conflicts, but even after that our code still was not running. Debugging was made particularly hard because the bug was related to how each of our files were communicating with each other and the different naming conventions that we each used.
