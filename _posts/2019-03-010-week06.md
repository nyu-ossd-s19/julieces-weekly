## Do you think such projects are easier or harder to get involved with?
I think they're probably harder to get involved with because of the nature of the projects. I imagine the communities working
on these types of projects are much more hardcore and less open to people who might not know entirely what they're doing. So,
for those reasons, I think it would be a really intimidating community to join.

## Do you think involvement in such projects bring more or less prestige to the contributor (compared to other projects)? 
I'm sure that the contributors feel better about working on projects that help people and communities in need, but I'm not
sure that these kinds of projects are more prestigious. I think it's more that being a contributor to these projects identifies
you as a humanitarian to some degree, and that might bring some prestige, but I don't think actually contributing to the
project is the thing that is prestigious

## Would you want to be involved in a project like that?
I would definitely be open to being involved in a project like that. I don't know that it would be a type of project that I 
would seek out myself because, like I said in the first response, I think this type of community would be a very intimidating
one to join, but if I were asked to make a contribution (or multiple) to a HFOSS project, I definitely wouldn't turn it down.
